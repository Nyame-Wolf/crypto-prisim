# Crypto Prism

**This app is built using react and reduxtoolkit. Ituses [coinlore](https://api.coinlore.net/api/tickers/). api to display a list of the best 100 cryptocurrency coins and their prices in descending order. A user can click on a coin to see the rest of the details about the coin. It has unit tests done using jest and integration testing that tests the whole application.**

## Built With

- HTML & CSS best practices: Correct use of tags, elements, properties and syntax.
- Gitflow: Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.
- REACT: Used to set the basic structure.
- REDUX: Centralizing application's state.
- COINLORE-API: Fetching data.
- Webpack: Source development for production bundling.
- Linters Check: Local and Pull Request Github workflows to check for stylistic errors, bugs and syntax errors in code.

### Prerequisites

- vscode or any ide
- Terminal
- Node

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Setup

- Clone this repo ~$ git clone
  - http : https://github.com/Nyame-Wolf/crypto-prisim.git
  - ssh :git@github.com:Nyame-Wolf/crypto-prisim.git
- Change directory to movie app ~$ cd movie-app

### Install

### `npm install`

### Usage

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run tests

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
